# AI-Genetic-Algorithm
## Genetic Algorithms
In this project, the mathematical equality problem is solved using a genetic algorithm.
Given an equation of length n and its answer, we use genetic methods to find what combination of operands and operators satisfy the equation.
## Game Minimax
In this project, the Sim pencil game is played by two agents.
One of them uses the alpha-beta minimax algorithm to play optimally, while the other agent plays randomly.
